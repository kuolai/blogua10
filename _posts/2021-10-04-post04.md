## A helper to our team

So far, as the owner of this blog site, we have been working at local repo with confidence that the remote repo is just one command `git pog` away to be sync'ed up and published, alone. What if we decide to add an assistant to help us review posts and give some feedbacks? Our helper, Bob, has no access to our local repo so I suggest he work on Github directly by
 - create a github account
 - read this post [Post04]
 - read [Github guides] to learn Github terms like `Repo`, `Branch`, `Commit`, and `Pull Request`
 - tell me his username (so I can add Bob as a collaborator)

### A use case: Edit a file at Github repo (The remote repo)

Our policy toward a helper is trust but verify: 
 - Trust Bob to add/modify/delete any part of posts ([Open a pull request])
 - Verify Bob's work at the final step (Merge a pull request)

In order for Bob to help us proof read our blog site, he will

  1. follow [Github guides]
  1. go to source repo at [blogua10-gh-repo]
  1. create a branch `post01-bob`
  1. edit _post/2021-09-28-post01.md
  1. commit changes
  1. open a pull requet
  1. give your PR a title and write a brief description
  1. create pull request

     It is up to us, the owner, to decide when and how to act on it.
  1. merge pull request
  1. delete the branch `post01-bob` as its mission has accomplished
  1. sync back to local repo

#### Step 3 ðŸ’¡ gotcha moments

Following [Github guides] is tricky, sometimes. E.g, a simple action like `create a branch` at step 3 may have unexpected result. Bob called and said he cannot create a branch, he did not see Fig. 3A as described in [Github guides], instead, he saw Fig.3B and could not continue.

 Fig. 3A :good: Create branch | Fig. 3B :hot_face: Find branch
 ------ | ------
 ![create branch]({{"/assets/img/create-branch.png" | relative_url }} ) | ![find branch]({{"/assets/img/find-branch.png" | relative_url }} )
 Expect this but... | It probably means Bob has no `write` right to repo

Turned out that I need to [invite collaborator] to enable Bob to my github repo. Problem solved. Also, Bob needs to accept the invitation in a week otherwise he will lose the `write` access right.

#### Step 4 cautions

When edit the file, make sure the branch name is `post01-bob` that you just created. 

#### Step 5 cautions

Make sure Bob chooses the default `commit directly`, NOT `create a new branch ...`.

![commit changes]({{"/assets/img/commit-changes.png" | relative_url | img_url: "200x200" }} )

#### Step 7 and 8 Cautions

Fig. 7 New PR | Fig. 8 Create PR
------ | ------
 ![new PR]({{"/assets/img/new-pr.png" | relative_url }} ) | ![create PR]({{"/assets/img/create-pr.png" | relative_url }} )
 Click `New Pull Request` | Click `Create Pull Request`
 
#### Step 9 Merge Pull Request

Fig. 9A Merge PR | Fig. 9B Confirm Merge
------ | ------
 ![Merge PR]({{"/assets/img/merge-pr.png" | relative_url }} ) | ![Confirm Merge]({{"/assets/img/confirm-merge.png" | relative_url }} )
 Click `Merge pull request` | Click `Confirm merge`

#### Step 10 Click `Delete the branch`

 ![delete branch]({{"/assets/img/merged-delete-branch.png" | relative_url }} )

#### Step 11 Sync to local Repo

After we merged the PR that Bob has opened, our remote repo is ahead of local repo. One commit ahead.

 - How can we tell if remote repo is ahead of local repo?
   - `git status` says nothing to commit as it only knows local repo,
   - `git remote show origin` says local out of date
   ```
   gh-pages pushes to gh-pages (local out of date)
   ```
 - How can we retrieve remote repo and sync it up?
   - `git fetch`
   - `git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/gh-pages gh-pages`
   ```
   Branch 'gh-pages' set up to track remote branch 'gh-pages' from 'origin'.
   ```
   - `git rebase`
   ```
   First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
   Fast-forwarded gh-pages to refs/remotes/origin/gh-pages.
   ```
 - Verify
   - `git remote show origin` says up to date, yes.
   ```
   gh-pages pushes to gh-pages (up to date)
   ```
 - Next time
   Once we have `set-upsteam-to` gh-pages, syncing remote to local needs just two commands
   - `git fetch`
   - `git rebase`

## Collaborations make sense

 Git version control and pull request are great tools to facilitate team collaborations. Collaborations are complicate. Thousands of collaboration use cases and articles challenge our patience to find an answer. I searched for a **Hello World** tutorial for beginners to get started with collaborations but to no avail.
 
 In our simpe use case
  - Only one remote branch (We did need the second branch to handle pull request. But it got deleted after merged pull request)
  - Only one local branch with the same branch name
  - Only two persons in a project
  - Bob, the helper, only works at remote repo and his work ends at `create pull request`
  - I, the owner, besides everything, will sync repos both ways
    - Local to remote, just one command `git push origin gh-pages`
    - Remote to local, just two commands
      - `git fetch`
      - `git rebase`
  
 I hope this post helps.

## Posts in markdown format

I use VS code to edit posts. A post is a [markdown] file (.md) looks like a normal article. 
 - Markdown provides semantic meaning for content in a relatively simple way.
 - You can write rich formatted content extremely quickly (compared to writing directly in HTML tags)
 - You can read Markdown easily in plain text before rendered by HTML. 
 - Markdown provides a simple syntax to write hyperlinks. 

### Posts with hyperlinks

A [hyperlink] is a word, phrase, or image that you can click on to jump to a new document or a new section within the current document. Hyperlinks allow the user to jump from page to page. Basically, hyperlinks allow people to browse information at hyperspeed.

#### Examples of defining hyperlinks:
```
# at the end of a post, put all hyperlinks together
# a link with relative url
[post01]: /jekyll/2021/09/28/post01.html
# a link to an absolute url
[blogua10-gh-repo]:   https://github.com/kuolai/blogua10
# a link to a footnote

```
#### Examples of using hyperlinks

The source code of [post01] is at [blogua10-gh-repo]

## Adding a post to a blog site

We are going to add a post to our blog site in a direction most authors do. I.e., add a post at local repo, commit, push to the remote repo, and wait a few minutes for Github to publish it.

$ `git status`  # we shall see a new file untracked (because it is newly created)
```
On branch gh-pages
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	_posts/2021-10-01-post03.md
```
$ `git add _posts/2021-10-01-post03.md` # track post03

$ `git commit -m "added post03"`  # commit means save changes

$ `git push origin gh-pages ` # push to remote repo (github will publish it in a minute)

See source at [Remote repo post03]

### Verify the project tree

Our dir tree is very clean, kudos to Jekyll's philosophy (gets out of your way).

```
# local repo
$ git ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD 
.gitignore
404.html
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
_config.yml
_posts/2021-09-28-post01.md
_posts/2021-09-28-post02.md
_posts/2021-09-29-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown
[*] _posts/2021-10-01-post03.md  ## newly added
about.markdown
index.markdown
```

### Save us some typings with Git Alias

From [tania blog] I learned git aliases which saves me some typings. In MacOS, edit ~/.gitconfig under your home directory as below.

~/.gitconfig
```
[alias]
  a      = add
  ca     = commit -a
  cam    = commit -am
  cm     = commit -m
  s      = status
  pom    = push origin master
  pog    = push origin gh-pages
  puom   = pull origin master
  puog   = pull origin gh-pages
  cob    = checkout -b
  co     = checkout
  fp     = fetch --prune --all
  l      = log --oneline --decorate --graph
  lall   = log --oneline --decorate --graph --all
  ls     = log --oneline --decorate --graph --stat
  lt     = log --graph --decorate --pretty=format:'%C(yellow)%h%Creset%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%cr) %C(bold blue)%an%Creset'
  tree   = ls-tree -r --name-only HEAD
```

## Recap - Easy sharing

Once we have a new post, we push it to Github to host with below shorthand commands everyday:
- `git s`  # for git status
- `git a _posts\.` # track it
- `git cm "added post03"` # commit
- `git pog`  # for git push origin gh-pages

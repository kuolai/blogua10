## Post01 Overview

We are going to operate a blog site by creating two repositories (repo's), a local repo and a remote repo. The local repo is for post writing and preview. The remote repo is to publish posts to the public. 
It is common to operate a blog site with two locations. A typical **use case** is the owner working on several posts (unfinished) locally, while subscribers read published posts from Internet.

From [Github Repo], a `repo` (repository) is usually used to organize a single project, e.g. a blog site. To make a project a repo, we use `git init` command. To convert a repo to a blog site, we choose `Jekyll` out of many tools/platforms as 
 - Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal project. 
 - Jekyll is also used by Github to host your remote site from your Github repo.  (ðŸ’¡ two birds in one stone)

Most tutorials teach web development and deployment, this tutorial goes a step further and adds operations related use cases. For examples, 
 - we added in a test angle by comparing remote site against locat site
 - we added debug process when erros occured
 - Also, the choice of Github to host our web site saves us works at
   - picking a name of url
   - selecting a host platform and dealing with monthly/annual fee
   - load balancing and scaling
 - we added a helper to demonstatrate team collaborations directly at remote repo

Now comes the technical part. We need a `local project/repo/server` and a `remote repo`. Notice the extra `local project` and `local server` that are not in remote site. It is because we need a project to host a web server at local site; while Github will host a remote server for us automatically. Sounds horrifying, hosting a server, worry not, just one jekyll command to learn. Actually, stay horrified, stay on your toes, you shall go far along the way.

This post [Post01] is created in [Markdown] format. You can see source code at [blogua10-gh-repo].

### Set up local project, repo and server

  $ `jekyll new blogua10`  # Start a new jekyll project called blogua10

  $ `cd blogua10`  

  $ `ls`  # Take a look at Jekyll project tree
```
404.html	Gemfile.lock	_posts		about.markdown
Gemfile		_config.yml	index.markdown
```

  $ `bundle add webrick`  # needed for Ruby version 3.0.0 or higher

  $ `bundle exec jekyll serve`  # Start local server

  $ `ls` # Show the tree again, _site/ is created by Jekyll, it contains content of our local blog site.
  ```
404.html	Gemfile.lock	_posts		about.markdown
Gemfile		_config.yml	_site		index.markdown
```

  Type `localhost:4000` in local browser and you shall see a Jekyll demo site

  $ `git status` # Take a look at the local repo
```
fatal: not a git repository
```

  We have a project tree but we have not connected it with git. Hence `git status` command shows error.

  $ `git init`  # Initialize the project tree as a git repo (This is our local repo) 

  $ `git status` # Ask agian, Git sees all files untracked
```
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.gitignore
	404.html
	Gemfile
	Gemfile.lock
	_config.yml
	_posts/
	about.markdown
	index.markdown
```

 `git init` creates a new file `.gitignore`. Edit it, add a line `_site` and save it. This tells Git to ignore (not track) any content under _site.

 $ `git add .`  # track all files

 $ `git commit -m "Initial commit"`  # Save all files to repo. On GitHub, saved changes are called commits.

 $ `git checkout -b gh-pages`  # Change the local branch name to gh-pages

 gh-pages branch has a special meaning in Github. We will use it in next section.

 $ `git status` # Verify the branch name is indeed gh-pages
```
On branch gh-pages
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```
 $ `git ls-tree --name-only HEAD` # git ls-tree is similar to `ls` with .gitignore effect
 ```
.gitignore
404.html
Gemfile
Gemfile.lock
_config.yml
_posts
about.markdown
index.markdown
```

### Set up remote repo and sync up with local repo

Create a repo with your browser at `github.com/new`. Name it `blogua10`. Leave everything empty. The address of our remote repo is at https://github.com/kuolai/blogua10.git.

 $ `git remote add origin https://github.com/kuolai/blogua10.git` # Connect to remote repo with a shorter name `origin`

 $ `git push origin gh-pages ` # push to remote repo at remote branch gh-pages (created automatically)

 It is time to revisit [Github Repo] and learn 'commit', 'branch' in addition to 'repo'.

 This command sync up remote repo branch `origin/gh-pages` with local repo `gh-pages` branch. 
  - The `from local to remote` **use case** is we create new content in the local repo, committed (saved changes), and sync up to the remote (at the same branch name).

 When we say sync up, we are actually sync up a `branch`. Branching is the way to work on different versions of a repository at one time. Why name it `gh-pages`? Can we use other branch name? Yes, we can name a branch with any name. Actually the default branch name is `main` for Github repos. However, the advantage of having a remote origin/gh-pages branch is that Github will automatically invoke Jekyll to generate a site and host it globally with no charge. See [Github gh-pages].

 Now browsing at `kuolai.github.io/blogua10`, you shall see a standard jekyll demo page.

### Check them out

#### Local site browsing at `localhost:4000`

#### Remote site browsing at `kuolai.github.io/blogua10`

Both sites have identical project tree and branch name, but look different. The local site looks prettier, while the remote site has no layout. You can see [site with no layout] here. See next post [Post02] for more explanations and fixes.

### Acknowledgement

In addition to build/deploy/operate a blog site, this tutorial tries to find a way to demonstrate the ultimate concept of web applicatoins i.e., **simple access**, **easy sharing**, and **collaboration with sense**.

 - Thanks to [Jekyll] to get us started with a blog template, and to convert a project tree to serve a web site.
 - Thanks to [Git] to turn a project to a repo and to track changes that I have already lost counts of my editions.
 - Thanks to [Github Pages] to integrate Jekyll to host public sites for us elegantly.
